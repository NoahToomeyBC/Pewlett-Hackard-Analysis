# "Silver Tsunami" Mentorship Program Analysis

## Overview of Project


### Purpose

In this project, we were tasked with performing data engineering on a number of databases to gain insight into who is retiring and what Pewlett Hackard can do in order to make sure that their efficiency does not take a hit as baby boomers begin to look to retirement. Pewlett Hackard has decided to create a mentorship program where new employees are paired up with veterans in similar fields. To accomplish this, we created several databases using the original employee and department databases to create a list of employees who are eligible for mentorship and employees who are close to retiring and are likely candidates for providing the mentorship. 

# Analysis


## Results
### Retiring Employees (By Title)
- Most of the retiring employees are retiring from senior level positions, making them ideal candidates for the mentorship program.
- Luckily, there are only two people retiring from a management level position so upper level operations will not be heavily affected by the incoming "silver tsunami"
- The majority of people retiring hold positions that will likely be in charge of managing day-to-day operations so small team lead mentorship will be imperative.



## Results 
### Mentorship Eligible Employees

- The majority of people eligibile for mentorship started working at Pewlett Hackard in the 1990's meaning they'll have at least 20 years of experience to impart on new employees.
- There are 1,550 employess who would make good candidates for the mentorship program.



# Summary

-How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  - There are a staggering 77,589 positions that will soon need to be filled. This means that ramping up hiring and replacement training will be imperative.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  - Not necessarily, however the overall impact of the silver tsunami can still be reduced by adjusting the mentorship program to have groups of mentees assigned to the most eligible mentors. This will also allow for the mentees to be able to learn and grow together to increase both healthy competition and a greater sense of unity.
